Given a **non-empty** string *s* and *a* dictionary *wordDict* containing a list of **non-empty** words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note:**

- The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
- You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]
Output:
[
  "cats and dog",
  "cat sand dog"
]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
s = "pineapplepenapple"
wordDict = ["apple", "pen", "applepen", "pine", "pineapple"]
Output:
[
  "pine apple pen apple",
  "pineapple pen apple",
  "pine applepen apple"
]
Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input:
s = "catsandog"
wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output:
[]
```
